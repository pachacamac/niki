# niki wiki
Tiny < 200 line batteries included flat file wiki engine I wrote years ago.

Rename `_users.yml` to `users.yml` and make your edits.

Features:

* Flat file
* Versioning
* Diff compare
* Users
* Groups
* Markdown
* Search
* Simple extensions

Doesn't have:

* Good security - uses SHA2 hashes without salt - could be improved easily
* Great readability - this is pretty hacked together
* The one feature you were looking for - create a pull request!
